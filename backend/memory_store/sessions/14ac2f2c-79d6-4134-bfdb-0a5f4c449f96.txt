User intent: Lol what is that wish
Key answer: It seems like we were just exchanging greetings. I think you might be referring to the phrase "back to you" as a wish or a response. It's a common idiomatic expression used to acknowledge someone's greeting or message, essentially saying "I'm responding to you."
